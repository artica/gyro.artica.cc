		  <h1>Prices</h1>
		  <p>Right now each Gyro is hand made. We are looking for industry partners that can help us take Gyro to the next level by ordering in bulk and industrializing the manufacturing process. This would significantly lower the cost per unit.<br><br>We are also in the process of launching a kickstarter campaign to finance building another batch of Gyros.<br><br>If you don't like waiting for any of that, you can <a href="mailto:info@artica.cc?subject=Order Custom Gyro">contact us</a> and get a quote for your very own customized hand made Gyro.<br><br>
		  We sell this product in four different packages:</p>

				<img src="gfx/thumb_motoruino2.jpg" />
				<p>Motoruino2</p>
				<p>Just the Motoruino2 board that powers Gyro. You're just missing the motors and the chassis to have a working robot. Motoruino2 is a full featured Arduino based board made specially for robotic needs with an 9-DOF IMU. Check <a href="gfx/flyer_motoruino2.jpg">this flyer</a> or contact us directly for more info. Does not include Bluetooth 2.0 communications module. Includes USB cable. Does not include LIPO battery.</p>

			  <div class="col span-3">
				<img src="gfx/thumb_gyro_sem_shell.jpg" />
				<p>Gyro without shell</p>
				<p>Motoruino2 with a basic chasis, includes 2 motors, a special PCB to interface with the front bumpers (includes 2 line sensors and 3 color sensors), a Bluetooth 2.0 communications module, a LIPO battery and USB cable.</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col span-3">
				<img src="gfx/thumb_gyro_vaccum_form.jpg" />
				<p>Gyro with vaccum form shell</p>
				<p>Gyro with a vaccum form shell. It's the cheapest shell available to protect the electronics while still allowing easy access for the curious minds to tinker with. Can be custom painted or decorated. Includes Bluetooth 2.0 communications module, LIPO battery and USB cable.</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col span-3">
				<img src="gfx/thumb_gyro_cast_mold.jpg" />
				<p>Gyro with cast mold shell</p>
				<p>Gyro with a more resilient cast mold shell. This shell is made using a different process, it's more sturdy and colorful but still allows access to the electronics. Includes Bluetooth 2.0 communications module, LIPO battery and USB cable.</p>

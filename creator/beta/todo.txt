constant read: "100"
constant write: "100"


device read : "the value read from the device X"
device write : "the new value for device device X"


variable read : "the value read from the device Bumper Right"
variable write : "the new value for device Motor Left"



This node hols the execution of his branch by "the value read from the device Knob" milliseconds.

This node copies "100" to "the new value for the device Led"


This node tests if "the value read from the device Knob" is less than "100"
This node tests if "the value read from the device Knob" is between "the value read from the device OutroDevice" and "100"


function_copy:
This node uses "the value read from the device Knob" as "the new value for device Motor Left"


function_map:
This node maps "the value read from the device Knob", ranging from "100" to "200" to a value ranging from "0" to "1000", and sets the new value as "the new value for device Motor Left"


function_random:
This node generates a random number between "the value read from the device Knob" and "100", and and sets that number as "the new value for device Motor Left"


function_range:
This node generates a value that starts in "the value read from the device Knob" and goes up to "100", then moves back to the first value. The value increases or decreases at a rate "the new value for device Motor Left"
